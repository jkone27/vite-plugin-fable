# Community Templates

⚠️ please note that vite-fable-plugin does **not officially support templates**. 

Templates are a way to showcase the plugin functionality or to help document the plugin usage. 

You can use them, but at your own risk, we appreciate if you want to publish more templates or contribute to them or use them as a starting point for your own templates.

### Feliz

Some [Feliz](https://fable-hub.github.io/Feliz/) templates are already using this plugin, ✅

* [feliz-vite (react)](https://github.com/jkone27/feliz-vite) 🪐: a template that combines Feliz react DSL and this awesome plugin as well as vitest and react testing library fable bindings, for extra awesme experience.

* [vite-feliz-solid](https://github.com/jkone27/feliz-vite-solid) 🌐: a template that combines Feliz JSX react dsl with solidjs, vitest, jsdom and vite.

### Express.js (WIP) ⚠️
* [vite-fable-server](https://github.com/jkone27/vite-fable-server) 🍇: a simple example combining the plugin with express.js (and glutinum bindings) as well as vite plugin server, for a simple backend application. ⚠️ tests not working atm. 

**NOTE**: Want to add to this list? please open an issue on our github repo, we are glad to add more examples for users.
